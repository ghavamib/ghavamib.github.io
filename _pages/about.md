I am a Research Fellow with extensive experience in Electronic Design Automation (EDA) and the reliability of digital and embedded systems. I earned my Ph.D. from Amirkabir University of Technology, where I focused on the High Yield Design of Nano-Scale Integrated Circuits. I have held a research fellow position at the SoC Research Group at the University of British Columbia (UBC), where my research centered on machine learning-driven EDA in FPGA design. I have contributed to academia as a Visiting Professor/sessional lecturer at Simon Fraser University and as an Associate Professor at Shahid Bahonar University of Kerman, Iran. My research spans a variety of fields, including innovative EDA methodologies, fault-tolerant design, the security and reliability of deep learning systems, machine learning-based chip design, and VLSI systems.
Additionally, I have industrial experience working with FPGA and Adaptive-SoC companies and startups.
